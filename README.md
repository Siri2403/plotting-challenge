# plotting-challenge

In this challenge, we see the analysis of data related to test drugs and the effect it has on mice.

Each mice is given an ID and detalis like the Drug used, the gender of the mice and other such details are recorded.

In the final scatter plot, it can be seen that there is a positive correlation between the size in weight of a mouse and the size of the tumor volume. Most mice were treated with either Capomulin or Ramicane.

Infubinol was the only drug analyzed that had an outlier.

Capomulin had a smaller variance in final tumor volume than the other three drugs analyzed.
Ceftamin had a larger variance in final tumor volume than the other three drugs analyzed.
Propriva wsa the least frequently used drug in the study.
